      "In XX/XX/XXXX my wages that I earned at my job decreased by almost half, by XX/XX/XXXX I knew I was in trouble with my home loan. I began contacting WFB whom my home loan is with, for assitance and options. \\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX I began the Loan Modification process with Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that they would not assist me with anything financial on my home loan until I fell 90 days behind, though at the time I started to inquire for assistance from WFB I was only a few weeks behind. So, I began working with a program called XXXX. They approved me for a variety of assistence and reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to determine what they could assist with. Wells Fargo then turned down the assistance from XXXX and finally offered to do a Loan Modification for me. The outcome was totally unknow about what I would be offered in the end by WFB for assistance. Wells Fargo lost my paperwork twice during this process, so it took 2 months from the time I started to the time my paperwork began to be processed for some kind of approval. In XX/XX/XXXX I was in a trial period of 3 months of payments based on a slightly modified amount. Roughly {$75.00} less than what I was paying on my original payment. However, my caseworker with WFB, failed to tell me that since the payments during this time were not the full amount of the original mortgage payment so they were not applied to the loan. I discovered this in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told by a creditor with XXXX that she could n't restore my line of credit because of something to do with my mortgage. I then called and found this out. My caseworker at WFB then told me it was n't her responsibility to tell me this information. I told her that she could have told me that if I could come up with the remaining amount of {$75.00} then the payments would be applied. Instead, she chose to withhold this information and damage my credit even further. Now we are into 5 months ( including the 90 days WFB told me I had to fall behind until they would help me ) without an applied payment to my home loan, going on 6 months. \\nMore paperwork was lost in XXXX as the modification was being finalized and my loan modification did n't go through until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a lawyer that is working on a class-action lawsuit against WFB for people in a similar situation and said this paper loss is typical. \\nWells Fargo did not reduce the interest rate, but they did reduce the payment by less than {$100.00} and the payments I was behind went back into the loan. \\nMy property taxes also fell behind in my escrow account at this time because there was no payment on the loan. So, I am behind on my property taxes, have damaged credit, and and I am not in any better payment situation than I was. \\nThey can not give me a reason on why they rejected XXXX assistance. I was originally told they were not an approved agency but on a later phone call to Wells Fargo Bank I was told that they work with that program often and the WFB employee could not understand why they would reject the help. I also spoke with XXXX and they said that Wells Fargo works with this program all the time and could n't understand why they would do this. \\nI feel that I have been taken advantage of by Wells Fargo and would like to pursue legal action against them based on negligence. \\nAlthough my payments are back on track I am not making much more money now than I was before so it is only a matter of time before something like this happens again if something unforeseen happens to my life that affects my finances. \\n    1\n",

      "I opened up an account at Bank of America in XXXX 2013. That same day I asked about getting a {$100.00} loan to the bank teller. She takes me outside to the ATM machine and pressed the loan button and requested {$200.00}. I was trusting that she knew what she was doing, but a couple days later I found out my account was closed and I could n't use any bank anymore. You can see on camera that she was the one with me requesting the loan and she is shown on camera pressing the buttons a couple of times. I have no record, no fraud, I dont even owe any banks and I 've been with about XXXX diffrent banks before. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a call at work from XXXX XXXX representing United Recovery Systems XXXX XXXX in regards to my father 's XXXX XXXX account ; he is the primary cardholder along with my mother. This was after XXXX XXXX took the monthly payment from my parents joint account which I discovered later that evening. XXXX XXXX proceeded to harass and demand that I do a check over the phone for the full amount of approximately {$3900.00}. I told her I would call her later because this seemed out of the blue and how in the world did my work number get involved if I am not the primary account holder. My parents opened the XXXX XXXX account back in XXXX. They have had the same home phone number since XXXX only now they have voicemail there were no messages or letters received at the home address that mentioned there was a problem with the account that was recently closed due to pressing and serious XXXX issues that caused late payments but from XXXX until now my parents always paid their bills on time. I calmly refused to discuss the account with XXXX XXXX and told her I would call back before XXXX that evening which I did but she apparently was unavailable so I spoke to another rep and told her that XXXX XXXX already deducted the past due amount ; furthermore I told the rep not to call my job ever again otherwise I plan to take this to another level. I do n't have the address of the collection agency because I never received anything in the mail stating that XXXX XXXX turned over the account to them. I did ask the representative that I spoke to later that evening on XXXX XXXX to send me a copy of the letter they allegedly sent. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "Augusta Collection Agency is vicious. I contacted them to pay once I found out the bill existed ( someone else actually used my credit card, but I wanted to pay it so it would not hurt my credit ). Augusta Collection Agency messed up the information I gave them to pay the bill. So, they called me, but my friend answered. They discussed the debt with this third party. Then when I called and complained the woman was rude to me. I asked for the manager and he got on the phone and was worse. He yelled, was profane and threatened to refuse to accept my payment and send the bill to collections, if I did not apologize to them. He was lying to me, because I did not know at the time it had already been reported on my credit. So, I had to apologize to them for them to accept my payment, even though they were in the wrong. They are horrible, XXXX people. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
